1. Take the octal number as input and store it in the variable octal.
2. Initialize the variables decimal and i to zero.
3. Obtain the remainder and quotient of the octal number. Multiply the remainder by powers of 8 using function pow(8, i++), add this value to the variable decimal and store it in the variable decimal.
4. Override the variable octal with quotient.
5. Repeat the steps 3 and 4 with the quotient obtained until the quotient becomes zero.
6. Print the variable decimal as output.
