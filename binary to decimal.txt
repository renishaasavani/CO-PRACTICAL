1. Take a binary number and store it in the variable num.
2. Initialize the variable decimal_val to zero and variable base to 1.
3. Obtain the remainder and quotient of the binary number. Store the remainder in the variable rem and override the variable num with quotient.
4. Multiply rem with variable base. Increment the variable decimal_val with this new value.
5. Increment the variable base by 2.
6. Repeat the steps 3, 4 and 5 with the quotient obtained until quotient becomes zero.
7. Print the variable decimal_val as output.
