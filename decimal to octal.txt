1. take a decimal number as input and store it in the variable decimalnum.
2. Copy the variable decimalnum to the variable quotient.
3. Divide the variable quotient and obtain its remainder and quotient. Store the remainder in the array octalNumber and override the variable quotient with the quotient obtained.
4. Repeat the step 3 until the quotient becomes zero.
5. When it becomes zero, print the array octalNumber in the reverse order to get the outp
