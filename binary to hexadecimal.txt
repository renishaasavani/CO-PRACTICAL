Program Explanation
1. Take a binary number as input and store it in the variable binaryval.
2. Obtain the remainder and quotient of the input number by dividing it by 10.
3. Multiply the obtained remainder with variable i and increment the variable hexadecimalval with this value.
4. Increment the variable i by 2 and override the variable binaryval with the quotient obtained.
5. Repeat the steps 2-4 until the variable binaryval becomes zero.
6. Print the variable hexadecimalval as output.
