1. Take a binary number as input and store it in the variable binarynum.
2. Obtain the remainder and quotient of the input number by dividing it by 10.
3. Multiply the obtained remainder with variable j and increment the variable octalnum with this value.
4. Increment the variable j by 2 and override the variable binarynum with the quotient obtained.
5. Repeat the steps 2-4 until the variable binarynum becomes zero.
6. Print the variable octalnum as output.
